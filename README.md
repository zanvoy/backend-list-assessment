# List1 & List2 Assignment
For this assignment, you'll be completing some list manipulation functions within the list1.py and list2.py files.

There is some light dependency on knowing how
[Functions](https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/controlflow.html#defining-functions)
work in python in terms of argument passing and return values, but you should
be able to figure it out as you go.

[list1.py](./list1.py) -- Complete the list functions in list1.py,
based on your knowledge of Python list iteration and indexing.

[list2.py](./list2.py) -- Additional list function completions.
