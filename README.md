# Kenzie Academy: Lists Assignment
For this assignment, you'll be completing some list manipulation functions within the list1.py and list2.py files.

There is some light dependency on knowing how
[Functions](https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/controlflow.html#defining-functions)
work in python in terms of argument passing and return values, but you should
be able to figure it out as you go.

[list1.py](./list1.py) -- Complete the list functions in list1.py,
based on your knowledge of Python list iteration and indexing.

[list2.py](./list2.py) -- Additional list function completions.

# Workflow for this Assignment
1. *Fork* this repository into your own personal github account.
2. Then *Clone* your own repo to your local development machine.
3. Complete the missing parts of the files to pass the built-in tests.
4. Commit your changes (with _meaningful_ commit messages e.g. not 'blah' or 'asdf' or 'updated code'), then `git push` back to your own github account.
5. From your personal Github repo, create a pull request (PR).  Add your instructor (and any other optional reviewers such as TAs and Coaches) to your PR, so that they can get a notification.  If you don't recall how to add reviewer(s) to a PR, please refresh on [this article](https://help.github.com/articles/requesting-a-pull-request-review/)
6. Copy/Paste the URL link to your PR as your assignment submission.

# Extra Points:
Feel free to edit the README.md (this very text itself) of this assignment and enhance it.  The README is the front-most facing page of your work, so it should make a good impression.  As assigments get more complex, you will be expected to create READMEs with sufficient detail to capture all aspects of how your code is intended to be used: Cloning, dependencies, gotchas, quick-starts, deployment notes, etc.
